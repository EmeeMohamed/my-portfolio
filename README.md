# my-portfolio

This is the final project for the **"Introduction to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript"** course by IBM. I’d like to share my work on this project with you. The task involves building a personal portfolio as a single static webpage to showcase to potential employers. To accomplish this, I will apply the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I’ve recently learned. The portfolio must include the following sections: **About Me, Skills, Projects, and Recommendations**.
